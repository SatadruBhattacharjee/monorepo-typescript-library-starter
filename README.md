# Monorepo TypeScript library starter


A Starter project that makes creating a Monorepo TypeScript library extremely easy.

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SatadruBhattacharjee/monorepo-typescript-library-starter.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME
rm -rf .git

# Run npm install
npm install
```

###Start coding!
- Please make necessary changes like `name`, `repository.url` in `package.json` file 
- and `ghToken`, `git config user.nam`, `git config user.email` in `tools/gh-page-publist.ts`
### Features

 - **[lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)** for monorepo pattern
 - **[RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/)** for multiple optimized bundles following the [standard convention](http://2ality.com/2017/04/setting-up-multi-platform-packages.html) and [Tree-shaking](https://alexjoverm.github.io/2017/03/06/Tree-shaking-with-Webpack-2-TypeScript-and-Babel/)
 - Tests, coverage and interactive watch mode using **[Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)**
 - **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)** and **[TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)** for code formatting and consistency
 - **Docs automatic generation and deployment** to `gh-pages`, using **[TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)**
 - Automatic types `(*.d.ts)` file generation
 - **[Travis](https://travis-ci.org)** integration and **[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)** report
 - (Optional) **Automatic releases and changelog**, using [Semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), [Conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (for the git hooks)

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import myLib from 'mylib'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
```

### NPM scripts

 - `npm test`: Run test suite
 - `npm build`: Run `npm run build` for all lerna packages/*
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)
 - `npm run docs` : To generate typedocs in your root for all packages/*
 - `npm run deploy-docs` : To deploy docs in your github gh-pages branch (make sure you have modified the required settings in `tools/gh-pages-publish.ts`)
 - `npm run semantic-release`: To make a semantic release

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

### Automatic releases

_**Prerequisites**: you need to create/login accounts and add your project to:_
 - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
 - [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)

_**Prerequisite for Windows**: Semantic-release uses
**[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)** so you will need to
install
[Microsoft's windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
using this command:_

```bash
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

#### Setup steps

Follow the console instructions to install semantic release and run it (answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?").

_Note: make sure you've setup `repository.url` in your `package.json` file_

```bash
npm install -g semantic-release-cli
semantic-release-cli setup
# IMPORTANT!! Answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?" question. It is already prepared for you :P
```

From now on, you'll need to use `npm run commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits.

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes your code automatically on [github](https://github.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

### Git Hooks

There is already set a `precommit`, `prepush` hook for formatting your code with Prettier and running the test suite :nail_care:


#### What if I don't want git-hooks, automatic releases or semantic-release?

Then you may want to:
 - Remove `commitmsg`, `postinstall` scripts from `package.json`. That will not use those git hooks to make sure you make a conventional commit
 - Remove `npm run semantic-release` from `.travis.yml`

#### What if I don't want to use coveralls or report my coverage?

Remove `npm run report-coverage` from `.travis.yml`
